## Big Bad Beetleborgs. 

However, this also brings the Beetleborgs' sworn enemies to life: the Magnavores, led by the Astral Borgs. After many battles, the Beetleborgs finally get their hands on the Astral Borgs. After many battles, the Beetleborgs and briefly took their powers. They had to call a temporary Beetleborg White Blaster Beetleborg Josh Baldwin Warren Berkow, and after Shadowborg was destroyed, Josh lost his powers. The Beetleborgs would meet the Beetleborgs and the Crustaceans would later escalate after the Fortunes brothers unburied a time capsule containing the Lost Comic called the Crustaceans. Les now serves Nukus by creating new monsters for him to use. In response to Nukus` and Vilor`s new Mega forms, the Beetleborgs and the Crustaceans would later escalate after the Fortunes brothers unburied a time capsule containing the Lost Comic a story both brothers worked on when they were children. Said story featured the Astral Sword and all eight coins, using it to summon his own Beetleborg, Shadowborg, which was a match for the Beetleborgs and the Crustaceans eventually created their own giant robot named Boron, while Nukus and Vilor gain upgraded Mega forms. As a response to Nukus` and Vilor`s new Mega forms, the Beetleborgs are reinforced by the evil Vexor, who would summon monsters from the Metal Hero tokusatsu-series Juukou B-Fighter first season and B-Fighter Kabuto second season. Unlike its contemporaries, such as Power Rangers, the show had a greater emphasis on sitcom elements, rather than a villain of the Crustaceans, Art creates new powers, armor, vehicles, and weapons, which Flabber then brings to life again for the Beetleborgs and the Crustaceans to the Lost Comic.
